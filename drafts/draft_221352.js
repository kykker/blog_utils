  '1/11 I start a thread on Loopring $LRCðŸ§µ Why I think they are building something much bigger than an exchange:\n\nFirst highlight is Loopring\'s Support Desk. As a comparison, Terra offers "support" only via Discord and provided "by the community" - whatever that means ðŸ‘€\n\n',
  "2/11 Unlike Terra, Loopring has an official Support Desk. This is pretty cool and might be understimated by us cryptonatives, but a support system is required for mass adoption.\n\nLoopring already has a direct on-ramp onto their L2 exchange. This is great for newjoiners",
  "3/11 It's never been easier to enjoy a low-fees trading experience.\n\nNow my favorite part: the NFTs developments :) Have you seen Loopring's the dynamic NFTs? Their Loopheads NFTs will change their image acoording to changes in $LRC prices\n\n",
  "4/11 Next Loopring can launch NFTs that change their image according to other event like a football match or a battle game ðŸ¤”\n\nYou'll be able to mint your own NFTs into your own contract. If you build an avatar accesory, you'll be able to mint and sell it on Loopring\n\n",
  '5/11 Since Loopring just moved into Decentraland, it hints their interest on this Metaverse. The NFTs you mint on Loopring might be wearables on your Decentraland avatar.\n\n',
  '6/11 Loopring is also building a solution to deploy out-of-the-box NFTs for "partners" - this could resemble to Steam model, where devs can publish their own games',
  "7/11 As a recap, if Loopring is building an NFT-based game, it could be one that let devs build their own games & accesories and deploy them directly onto L2 with low fees ðŸ¤¯\n\n",
  "8/11 And on top of that, the upcoming LoopringDAO might be the body that curates/vote for games or NFT artists to be funded. ",
  "9/11 Overall, it looks like Loopring is building something big on the NFT space and we are witnessing how they build the pieces of the entire puzzle.\n\n",
  "10/11 A word of caution, Grayscale announced in June 2021 that they were researching $LRC together with other tokens",
  "11/11 All the other tokens, already have a Trust registered in Delaware except for $LRC  ðŸ‘€",
